# 1. What is Cloud & DevOps?

### The cloud is ability to access resources over the internet in a pay as you go service.

### DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services fast and efficiently.

### <what you created with that tool / concept>

### Cloud Computing - You only pay for what you use and rather than having in-house servers and software, businesses can use cloud-based services to access the same applications and data from any computer or device with an internet connection.

### DevOps - Faster, better product delivery. Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity. Greater scalability and availability. More stable operating environments. You eliminate human error. A DevOps mindset is to optimize the flow of value from idea to end user.



# 2. What is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery

### Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

### Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.

#### We implemented a Jenkins pipeline.

#### CI/CD creates a fast and effective process of getting your product to market before your competition as well as releasing new features and bug fixes to keep your current customers happy.

#### Smaller code changes, fault isolations, faster mean time to resolution, more test reliability, faster release rate, smaller backlog, customer satifaction, increase team transparency and accountability, and reduce costs.

# 3. What is Jenkins?

### Jenkins is an open source (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.

### A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software.

#### <continuous integration>

#### I automated testing when code was pushed to github using webhooks.

#### Jenkins allows you to automate the process and there is less chance of human error by eliminating manual steps. This allows developers to focus more on continuously improving and innovating a product.

# 4. What is Provisioning?

### Provisioning is the process of setting up IT infrastructure.

### I created bash scripts using linux. 

### The benefits of provisioning allows developers to quickly and automatically spin up an array of workloads on demand.
